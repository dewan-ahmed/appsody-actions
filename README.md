# Appsody GitHub-Actions Tutorial
This tutorial walks through creating a continuous integration flow by using GitHub Actions for an Appsody Node.js/Express application. 

## Taking care of the pre-requisites

These steps are executed on linux(Ubuntu 18.04) but you can follow similar steps for Windows/Mac.

### Installing Java

Get the latest version from [openJDK](https://jdk.java.net)
During the time of this tutorial, version 13.0.1 is the latest. Update the following code to the jdk version you're using.

```
wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk13.0.1/cec27d702aa74d5a8630c65ae61e4305/9/GPL/openjdk-13.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
tar xvf openjdk-13.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
export JAVA_HOME=$PWD/jdk-13.0.1/
export PATH=${PATH}:${JAVA_HOME}/bin
```

### Installing Docker

```
sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker dewan
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Log-out and log back in for the above changes to reflect on your account.

### Installing Appsody:

Get the latest version from [Appsody Installation Doc](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/) and update the following code/version, if required.
```
wget https://github.com/appsody/appsody/releases/download/0.4.9/appsody_0.4.9_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -f $PWD/appsody_0.4.9_amd64.deb
```
Once the above steps are done, type in **appsody** on your terminal and hit enter. If you see something like the following, your installation was successful:
```
The Appsody command-line tool (CLI) enables the rapid development of cloud native applications.

## Creating your Appsody project

Create a project folder and follow the commands below to init an Appsody Node.js/Express project

```
mkdir appsody-actions
cd appsody-actions
appsody init nodejs-express
```
Once the project initializes, create a repository on GitHub and push your project contents to that repository.

## Creating a docker hub image registry

1. Go to hub.docker.com and login/register.
2. Create a new image registry by going to hub.docker.com/repository/create

## Adding a Dockerfile in your project directory

At the root of your project, add the following Dockerfile and commit to your git repository

```
FROM node:12

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "node", "server.js" 
```

## Adding Continuous Integration to your repository using GitHub Actions

1. From your newly created github repository, go to Settings --> Secret and add two parameters - DOCKER_HUB and DOCKER_HUB_KEY. Use your dockerhub username for the first parameter and dockerhub password for the latter.
2. Create a new file called *build.yml* in the root of your project folder /.github/workflows/build.yml
3. Copy the following contents in that file (*Make sure to replace <dockerUsername/reponame> with your docker username and the newly created image registry you just created*)
```
name: Appsody-Actions CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: build-push
      env:
        DOCKER_HUB: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB }}
        DOCKER_HUB_KEY: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_KEY }}
      run: |
        echo 'Docker Login...'
        docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB -p $DOCKER_HUB_KEY
        echo 'running build...'
        docker build . -t <dockerUsername/reponame>
        echo 'Pushing image...'
        docker push <dockerUsername/reponame>
        echo 'Done!'
```       

That's it. Now you can go back to your project, make any change to any source file and push to master (for example, change line#4 on app.js to display *Hello from Appsody-Actions*). You'll be seeing live logs on your CI build and have the image pushed to your docker image registry after a successful build.
